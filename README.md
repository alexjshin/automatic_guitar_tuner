# Automatic Guitar Tuner

Authors: Alex Shin and Jinwoo Kim

## Project Description

The goal of this project, as described by the name, was to create an embedded system that automatically tunes any guitar (for this project, we used an acoustic guitar). Our system employs two sound sensors to capture the audio signals generated by plucking the guitar strings. We also have a button along with six LEDs for the user to click through and select the string that they want to tune. Upon selecting a string to tune, the user can attach the motor to the guitar peg of that string, pluck the string, and the motor will automatically rotate to tune the guitar. When the string is in tune, an indicator LED will turn green to indicate that the selected guitar string is in tune (will be off when the string is out-of-tune). By automating the tuning process, our project seeks to offer guitarists a convenient and efficient solution for achieving optimal tuning accuracy without the need for manual adjustment, especially for enthusiasts without musically trained ears.

We have included a project writeup (`Guitar_Tuner_Writeup.pdf`) that provides a lot more detail about this project (i.e. materials used, design process, limitations, problems encountered, etc).
